    When other adults find out that my dad is a single father of three girls, they shake their heads in admiration, like
    How does he do it? How does he ever manage that all by himself? The answer is Margot. She’s been an organizer from
    the start, everything labeled and scheduled and arranged in neat, even rows.
    <br />
    <br />
    Margot is a good girl, and I guess Kitty and I have followed her lead. I’ve never cheated or gotten drunk or smoked
    a cigarette or even had a boyfriend. We tease Daddy and say how lucky he is that we’re all so good, but the truth
    is, we’re the lucky ones. He’s a really good dad. And he tries hard. He doesn’t always understand us, but he tries,
    and that’s the important thing. We three Song girls have an unspoken pact: to make life as easy as possible for
    Daddy. But then again, maybe it’s not so unspoken, because how many times have I heard Margot say, “Shh, be quiet,
    Daddy’s taking a nap before he has to go back to the hospital,” or “Don’t bother Daddy with that; do it yourself”?
    <br />
    <br />
    I’ve asked Margot what she thinks it would have been like if Mommy hadn’t died. Like would we spend more time with
    our Korean side of the family and not just on Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day? Or—

    Margot doesn’t see the point in wondering. This is our life; there’s no use in asking what if. No one could ever
    give you the answers. I try, I really do, but it’s hard for me to accept this way of thinking. I’m always wondering
    about the what-ifs, about the road not taken.

    Daddy and Kitty come downstairs at the same time. Margot pours Daddy a cup of coffee, black, and I pour milk in
    Kitty’s cereal bowl. I push it in front of her, and she turns her head away from me and gets a yogurt out of the
    fridge. She takes it into the living room to eat in front of the TV. So she’s still mad.

    “I’m going to go to Costco later today, so you girls make a list for whatever you need,” Daddy asks, taking a big
    sip of coffee. “I think I’ll pick up some New York strips for dinner. We can grill out. Should I get one for Josh,
    too?”
    <br />
    <br />
    “No, I’m just telling you.” “It’s not like he would come over here that
    much once I was gone, anyway.” I frown. This didn’t occur to me, that Josh
    would stop coming over because Margot was gone. He was coming over long
    before they were ever a couple, so I don’t see why he should stop. “He
    might,” I say. “He really loves Kitty.” She pushes the start button on the
    coffee machine. I’m watching her super carefully because Margot’s always
    been the one to make the coffee and I never have, and now that she’s
    leaving (only six more days), I’d better know how. With her back to me she
    says, “Maybe I won’t even mention it to them.” “Um, I think they’ll figure
    it out when he’s not at the airport, Gogo.” Gogo is my nickname for
    Margot. As in go-go boots. “How many cups of water did you put in there?
    And how many spoons of coffee beans?” “I’ll write it all down for you,”
    Margot assures me. “In the notebook.” We keep a house notebook by the
    fridge. Margot’s idea, of course. It has all the important numbers and
    Daddy’s schedule and Kitty’s carpool. “Make sure you put in the number for
    the new dry cleaners,” I say. “Already done.” Margot slices a banana for
    her cereal: each slice is perfectly thin. “And also, Josh wouldn’t have
    come to the airport with us anyway. You know how I feel about sad
    good-byes.” Margot makes a face, like Ugh, emotions. I do know. When
    Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even
    though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to
    college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college
    in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with
    the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us
    one day. I’m still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit.
    Obviously I know it’s not her fault. But she’s going so far away, and we
    always said we’d be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the
    middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is
    Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because
    that’s what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny,
    hairless kitten. We are the three Song girls. There used to be four. My
    mom, Eve Song. Evie to my dad, Mommy to us, Eve to everyone else. Song is,
    was, my mom’s last name. Our last name is Covey—Covey like lovey, not like
    cove. But the reason we are the Song girls and not the Covey girls is my
    mom used to say that she was a Song girl for life, and Margot said then we
    should be too. We all have Song for our middle name, and we look more Song
    than Covey anyway, more Korean than white. At least Margot and I do; Kitty
    looks most like Daddy: her hair is light brown like his. People say I look
    the most like Mommy, but I think Margot does, with her high cheekbones and
    dark eyes. It’s been almost six years now, and sometimes it feels like
    just yesterday she was here, and sometimes it feels like she never was,
    only in dreams. She’d mopped the floors that morning; they were shiny and
    everything smelled like lemons and clean house. The phone was ringing in
    the kitchen, she came running in to answer it, and she slipped. She hit
    her head on the floor, and she was unconscious, but then she woke up and
    she was fine. That was her lucid interval. That’s what they call it. A
    little while later she said she had a headache, she went to lie down on
    the couch, and then she didn’t wake up. Margot was the one who found her.
    She was twelve. She took care of everything: she called 911; she called
    Daddy; she told me to watch over Kitty, who was only three. I turned on
    the TV for Kitty in the playroom and I sat with her. That’s all I did. I
    don’t know what I would have done if Margot hadn’t been there. Even though
    Margot is only two years older than me, I look up to her more than
    anybody.
