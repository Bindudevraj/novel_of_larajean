    <h4>
      JOSH IS MARGOT’S BOYFRIEND, BUT I guess you could say my whole family is a
      little in love with him. It’s hard to say who most of all. Before he was
      Margot’s boyfriend, he was just Josh. He was always there. I say always,
      but I guess that’s not true. He moved next door five years ago but it
      feels like always.My dad loves Josh because he’s a boy and my dad is
      surrounded by girls.
      I mean it: all day long he is surrounded by females.
      My dad is an ob-gyn, and he also happens to be the father of three
      daughters, so it’s like girls, girls, girls all day. He also likes Josh
      because Josh likes comics and he’ll go fishing with him. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My dad tried to
      take us fishing once, and I cried when my shoes got mud on them, and
      Margot cried when her book got wet, and Kitty cried because Kitty was
      still practically a baby. Kitty loves Josh because he’ll play cards with
      her and not get bored. Or at least pretend to not get bored. They make
      deals with each other—if I win this next hand, you have to make me a
      toasted crunchy-peanut-butter-sandwich, no crusts. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      That’s Kitty.
      Inevitably there won’t be crunchy peanut butter and Josh will say too bad,
      pick something else. But then Kitty will wear him down and he’ll run out
      and buy some, because that’s Josh. If I had to say why Margot loves him, I
      think maybe I would say it’s because we all do. We are in the living room,
      Kitty is pasting pictures of dogs to a giant piece of cardboard. There’s
      paper and scraps all around her. Humming to herself, she says, “When Daddy
      asks me what I want for Christmas, I am just going to say, ‘Pick any one
      of these breeds and we’ll be good.’?”. Margot and Josh are on the couch;
      I’m lying on the floor, watching TV. Josh popped a big bowl of popcorn,
      and I devote myself to it, handfuls and handfuls of it. A commercial comes
      on for perfume: a girl is running around the streets of Paris in an
      orchid-colored halter dress that is thin as tissue paper. What I wouldn’t
      give to be that girl in that tissue-paper dress running around Paris in
      springtime! I sit up so suddenly I choke on a kernel of popcorn. Between
      coughs I say, “Margot, let’s meet in Paris for my spring break!”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I’m already picturing myself twirling with a pistachio macaron in one hand and
      a raspberry one in the other. Margot’s eyes light up. “Do you think Daddy
      will let you?” “Sure, it’s culture. He’ll have to let me.” But it’s true
      that I’ve never flown by myself before. And also I’ve never even left the
      country before. Would Margot meet me at the airport, or would I have to
      find my own way to the hostel? Josh must see the sudden worry on my face
      because he says, “Don’t worry. Your dad will definitely let you go if I’m
      with you.” I brighten. “Yeah! We can stay at hostels and just eat pastries
      and cheese for all our meals.” “We can go to Jim Morrison’s grave!” Josh
      throws in. “We can go to a parfumerie and get our personal scents done!” I
      cheer, and Josh snorts. “Um, I’m pretty sure ‘getting our scents done’ at
      a parfumerie would cost the same as a week’s stay at the hostel,” he says.
      He nudges Margot. “Your sister suffers from delusions of grandeur.” “She
      is the fanciest of the three of us,” Margot agrees. “What about me?” Kitty
      whimpers. “You?” I scoff. “You’re the least fancy Song girl. I have to beg
      you to wash your feet at night, much less take a shower.” Kitty’s face
      gets pinched and red. “I wasn’t talking about that, you dodo bird. I was
      talking about Paris.” Airily, I wave her off. “You’re too little to stay
      at a hostel.” She crawls over to Margot and climbs in her lap, even though
      she’s nine and nine is too big to sit in people’s laps. “Margot, you’ll
      let me go, won’t you?” “Maybe it could be a family vacation,” Margot says,
      kissing her cheek. “You and Lara Jean and Daddy could all come.” I frown.
      That’s not at all the Paris trip I was imagining. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Over Kitty’s head Josh
      mouths to me, We’ll talk later, and I give him a discreet thumbs-up. It’s
      later that night; Josh is long gone. Kitty and our dad are asleep. We are
      in the kitchen. Margot is at the table on her computer; I am sitting next
      to her, rolling cookie dough into balls and dropping them in cinnamon and
      sugar. Snickerdoodles to get back in Kitty’s good graces. Earlier, when I
      went in to say good night, Kitty rolled over and wouldn’t speak to me
      because she’s still convinced I’m going to try to cut her out of the Paris
      trip. My plan is to put the snickerdoodles on a plate right next to her
      pillow so she wakes up to the smell of fresh-baked cookies. Margot’s being
      extra quiet, and then, out of nowhere, she looks up from her computer and
      says, “I broke up with Josh tonight. After dinner.” My cookie-dough ball
      falls out of my fingers and into the sugar bowl. “I mean, it was time,”
      she says. Her eyes aren’t red-rimmed; she hasn’t been crying, I don’t
      think. Her voice is calm and even. Anyone looking at her would think she
      was fine. Because Margot is always fine, even when she’s not. “I don’t see
      why you had to break up,” I say. “Just ’cause you’re going to college
      doesn’t mean you have to break up.” “Lara Jean, I’m going to Scotland, not
      UVA. Saint Andrews is nearly four thousand miles away.” She pushes up her
      glasses. “What would be the point?” I can’t even believe she would say
      that. “The point is, it’s Josh. Josh who loves you more than any boy has
      ever loved a girl!” Margot rolls her eyes at this. She thinks I’m being
      dramatic, but I’m not. It’s true—that’s how much Josh loves Margot. He
      would never so much as look at another girl. Suddenly she says, “Do you
      know what Mommy told me once?” “What?” For a moment I forget all about
      Josh. Because no matter what I am doing in life, if Margot and I are in
      the middle of an argument, if I am about to get hit by a car, I will
      always stop and listen to a story about Mommy. Any detail, any remembrance
      that Margot has, I want to have it too. I’m better off than Kitty, though.
      Kitty doesn’t have one memory of Mommy that we haven’t given her. We’ve
      told her so many stories so many times that they’re hers now. “Remember
      that time . . . ,” she’ll say. And then she’ll tell the story like she was
      there and not just a little baby.
