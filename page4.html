      “She told me to try not to go to college with a boyfriend. She said she
      didn’t want me to be the girl crying on the phone with her boyfriend and
      saying no to things instead of yes.”
      <br />
      <br />
      Scotland is Margot’s yes, I guess. Absently, I scoop up a mound of cookie
      dough and pop it in my mouth.“You shouldn’t eat raw cookie dough,” Margot
      says. I ignore her. “Josh would never hold you back from anything. He’s
      not like that. Remember how when you decided to run for student-body
      president, he was your campaign manager? He’s your biggest fan!” At this,
      the corners of Margot’s mouth turn down, and I get up and fling my arms
      around her neck. She leans her head back and smiles up at me. “I’m okay,”
      she says, but she isn’t, I know she isn’t. “It’s not too late, you know.
      You can go over there right now and tell him you changed your mind.”
      <br />
      <br />
      Margot shakes her head. “It’s done, Lara Jean.” I release her and she
      closes her laptop. “When will the first batch be ready? I’m hungry.” I
      look at the magnetic egg timer on the fridge. “Four more minutes.” I sit
      back down and say, “I don’t care what you say, Margot. You guys aren’t
      done. You love him too much.” She shakes her head. “Lara Jean,” she
      begins, in her patient Margot voice, like I am a child and she is a wise
      old woman of forty-two. I wave a spoonful of cookie dough under Margot’s
      nose, and she hesitates and then opens her mouth. I feed it to her like a
      baby. “Wait and see, you and Josh will be back together in a day, maybe
      two.” But even as I’m saying it, I know it’s not true. Margot’s not the
      kind of girl to break up and get back together on a whim; once she’s
      decided something, that’s it. There’s no waffling, no regrets. It’s like
      she said: when she’s done, she’s just done. I wish (and this is a thought
      I’ve had many, many times, too many times to count) I was more like
      Margot. Because sometimes it feels like I’ll never be done. Later, after
      I’ve washed the dishes and plated the cookies and set them on Kitty’s
      pillow, I go to my room. I don’t turn the light on. I go to my window.
      Josh’s light is still on. 2 THE NEXT MORNING, MARGOT IS making coffee and
      I am pouring cereal in bowls, and I say the thing I’ve been thinking all
      morning. “Just so you know, Daddy and Kitty are going to be really upset.”
      When Kitty and I were brushing our teeth just now, I was tempted to go
      ahead and spill the beans, but Kitty was still mad at me from yesterday,
      so I kept quiet. She didn’t even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she
      ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. Margot lets
      out a heavy sigh. “So I’m supposed to stay with Josh because of you and
      Daddy and Kitty?”
      <br />
      <br />
      “No, I’m just telling you.” “It’s not like he would come over here that
      much once I was gone, anyway.” I frown. This didn’t occur to me, that Josh
      would stop coming over because Margot was gone. He was coming over long
      before they were ever a couple, so I don’t see why he should stop. “He
      might,” I say. “He really loves Kitty.” She pushes the start button on the
      coffee machine. I’m watching her super carefully because Margot’s always
      been the one to make the coffee and I never have, and now that she’s
      leaving (only six more days), I’d better know how. With her back to me she
      says, “Maybe I won’t even mention it to them.” “Um, I think they’ll figure
      it out when he’s not at the airport, Gogo.” Gogo is my nickname for
      Margot. As in go-go boots. “How many cups of water did you put in there?
      And how many spoons of coffee beans?” “I’ll write it all down for you,”
      Margot assures me. “In the notebook.” We keep a house notebook by the
      fridge. Margot’s idea, of course. It has all the important numbers and
      Daddy’s schedule and Kitty’s carpool. “Make sure you put in the number for
      the new dry cleaners,” I say. “Already done.” Margot slices a banana for
      her cereal: each slice is perfectly thin. “And also, Josh wouldn’t have
      come to the airport with us anyway. You know how I feel about sad
      good-byes.” Margot makes a face, like Ugh, emotions. I do know. When
      Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even
      though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to
      college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college
      in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with
      the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us
      one day. I’m still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit.
      Obviously I know it’s not her fault. But she’s going so far away, and we
      always said we’d be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the
      middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is
      Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because
      that’s what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny,
      hairless kitten. We are the three Song girls. There used to be four. My
      mom, Eve Song. Evie to my dad, Mommy to us, Eve to everyone else. Song is,
      was, my mom’s last name. Our last name is Covey—Covey like lovey, not like
      cove. But the reason we are the Song girls and not the Covey girls is my
      mom used to say that she was a Song girl for life, and Margot said then we
      should be too. We all have Song for our middle name, and we look more Song
      than Covey anyway, more Korean than white. At least Margot and I do; Kitty
      looks most like Daddy: her hair is light brown like his. People say I look
      the most like Mommy, but I think Margot does, with her high cheekbones and
      dark eyes. It’s been almost six years now, and sometimes it feels like
      just yesterday she was here, and sometimes it feels like she never was,
      only in dreams. She’d mopped the floors that morning; they were shiny and
      everything smelled like lemons and clean house. The phone was ringing in
      the kitchen, she came running in to answer it, and she slipped. She hit
      her head on the floor, and she was unconscious, but then she woke up and
      she was fine. That was her lucid interval. That’s what they call it. A
      little while later she said she had a headache, she went to lie down on
      the couch, and then she didn’t wake up. Margot was the one who found her.
      She was twelve. She took care of everything: she called 911; she called
      Daddy; she told me to watch over Kitty, who was only three. I turned on
      the TV for Kitty in the playroom and I sat with her. That’s all I did. I
      don’t know what I would have done if Margot hadn’t been there. Even though
      Margot is only two years older than me, I look up to her more than
      anybody.
